Capability: Nuclear Reactor Control
Feature: Emergency Safety Systems

Use Case 4: Emergency Reactor Shutdown
Goal: Reactor can be safely shut down in emergency

Preconditions:
- Reactor is in operational state
- Safety systems are functional
- Control rods are positioned correctly
- Cooling systems are operational

Actors: Operator, Safety System

Main Flow:
B1 (trigger) Lightning strikes the main power line of the nuclear plant
B2a The system immediately inserts control rods
B2b The system activates emergency cooling
B2c The system isolates reactor containment
B3 The system monitors radiation levels
B4 The system confirms shutdown completion
B5 The system notifies operators of status
B6 End UC

Postcondition:
Reactor is safely shut down and contained.

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2a Control rod insertion fails
A1.1 The system activates backup control systems
A1.2 The system increases cooling flow rate
A1.3 The system triggers facility evacuation
A1.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Emergency protocols activated, facility secured.

A2 at B2b Cooling system failure
A2.1 The system activates backup cooling
A2.2 The system vents steam safely
A2.3 The system maintains containment integrity
A2.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Reactor contained with backup systems active.
