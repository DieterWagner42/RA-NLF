Capability: Satellite Deployment
Feature: Autonomous Rocket Launch

Use Case 3: Execute Satellite Launch Mission
Goal: Mission Control successfully deploys satellite into target orbit autonomously

Preconditions:
- Rocket propellant is loaded and verified
- Satellite payload is integrated and tested
- Weather conditions meet launch criteria
- Launch window is calculated and available
- Ground systems are operational and ready

Actors: Mission Control, Launch Sequencer, Ground Systems

Main Flow:
B1 (trigger) Launch window opens at scheduled time
B2a The system validates all subsystems against launch criteria
B2b The Mission Control calculates optimal trajectory for target orbit
B3 The Mission Control send trajectory to the system
B4a The Launch Sequencer generates launch sequence with timing parameters
B4b The system loads flight program into guidance computer
B5a The Launch Sequencer initiates propellant flow to combustion chamber
B5b The Launch Sequencer ignites main engines with thrust vector control
B5c The system monitors flight telemetry against planned trajectory
B6a The system separates first stage at calculated altitude
B6b The system ignites second stage for orbital insertion
B7a The system deploys satellite at target orbital position
B7b The system confirms satellite deployment with telemetry data
B8 The system transmits mission success report to mission control
B9 End UC

Postcondition:
Satellite is successfully deployed in target orbit with confirmed telemetry.

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2a Critical subsystem fails validation
A1.1 The system generates failure report with diagnostic data
A1.2 The system activates abort sequence with safety protocols
A1.3 The system transmits abort notification to mission control
A1.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Launch is safely aborted, all systems secured.


A3 at B6a Stage separation failure detected
A3.1 The system attempts secondary separation mechanism
A3.2 If separation succeeds, system continues with second stage ignition
A3.3 If separation fails, system executes mission abort procedures
A3.4 The system transmits separation status to mission control
A3.5 End UC

Postcondition:
Stage separation completed or mission safely terminated.

Extension Flows:
E1 at B5a Satellite requires orbital adjustment
E1.1 The system calculates orbital correction parameters
E1.2 The system executes satellite thruster burn for final positioning
E1.3 The system verifies satellite orbital parameters against target
E1.4 Continue with B5b

E2 at any time Ground control requests telemetry data
E2.1 The system packages current flight data into telemetry stream
E2.2 The system transmits real-time telemetry to ground stations
E2.3 Continue with current flow
