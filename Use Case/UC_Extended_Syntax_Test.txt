Capability: Extended Syntax Testing
Feature: UC Syntax Extensions

Use Case: Test Extended UC Syntax
Goal: Validate all extended UC syntax elements

Preconditions:
- System is ready for testing
- Extended syntax parser is implemented

Actors: System Admin, Test Controller

Basic Flow:
B1 (trigger) Test sequence starts at scheduled time
B2 The system validates syntax elements
B3 The system processes basic flow statements
B4 Continue main flow
B5 End UC

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2 Syntax validation fails
A1.1 The system generates error report
A1.2 Continue at B5
A1.3 End Use Case

A2 at B3 Processing encounters error
A2.1 The system attempts recovery
A2.2 Continue with B4
A2.3 End UC

Extension Flows:
E1 at B2 Additional validation required
E1.1 The system performs extended validation
E1.2 Continue basic flow
E1.3 Continue at step B3

E2 at any time Admin requests status
E2.1 The system provides status information
E2.2 Continue in main flow

Postcondition:
All syntax elements are properly parsed and processed.
