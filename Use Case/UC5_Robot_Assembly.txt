Capability: Robotic Manufacturing
Feature: Precision Assembly

Use Case 5: Assemble Product Components
Goal: Robot can assemble components with precision

Preconditions:
- Components are available in work area
- Robot is calibrated and operational
- Assembly tools are attached
- Quality sensors are functional

Actors: Operator, Quality Control System

Main Flow:
B1 (trigger) Operator initiates assembly sequence
B2a The system scans component positions
B2b The system plans assembly path
B2c The system picks up first component
B3a The system positions component precisely
B3b The system applies joining process (screwing/welding)
B4 The system performs quality check
B5 The system places completed assembly in output area
B6 End UC

Postcondition:
Product is assembled and quality verified.

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2a Component missing or mispositioned
A1.1 The system alerts operator
A1.2 The system waits for component correction
A1.3 Continue from B2a when ready
A1.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Assembly paused, operator intervention required.

A2 at B4 Quality check fails
A2.1 The system marks component as defective
A2.2 The system places component in reject area
A2.3 The system notifies quality control
A2.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Defective assembly identified and removed.
