Capability: UC Syntax Extension Testing
Feature: Complete Extended Syntax Support
Use Case: UC_Extended_Syntax_Complete_Test
Goal: Validate all extended UC syntax elements including Basic Flow, End statements, and Continue variations

Preconditions:
- System is ready for testing
- Extended syntax parser is implemented
- All flow types are supported

Actors: System Admin, Test Controller

Basic Flow:
B1 (trigger) Test sequence starts at scheduled time
B2 The system validates syntax elements
B3 The system processes basic flow statements
B4 Continue main flow
B5 The system completes validation
B6 End UC

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2 Syntax validation fails
A1.1 The system generates error report
A1.2 The system logs validation failure
A1.3 End Use Case

A2 at B3 Processing encounters error
A2.1 The system handles processing error
A2.2 Continue basic flow
A2.3 End UC

Extension Flows:
E1 at B2 Additional validation required
E1.1 The system performs extended validation
E1.2 Continue with basic flow
E1.3 The system performs additional checks
E1.4 Continue with B5

E2 at any time Admin requests status
E2.1 The system provides current status
E2.2 Continue at B3

E3 at B4 Special processing needed
E3.1 The system performs special processing
E3.2 Continue with main flow

E4 at B5 Final check required
E4.1 The system performs final validation
E4.2 Continue at step B6
