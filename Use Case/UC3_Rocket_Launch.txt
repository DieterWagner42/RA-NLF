Capability: Rocket Launch
Feature: Satellite Deployment

Use Case 3: Execute Satellite Launch
Goal: Mission control can launch satellite into orbit at scheduled time

Preconditions:
- Rocket is fueled and ready
- Satellite payload is installed
- Weather conditions are acceptable
- Launch window is available

Actors: Mission Control, Launch Sequencer

Main Flow:
B1 (trigger) Launch window opens at scheduled time
B2a The system performs final systems check
B2b The system activates launch sequencer
B2c The system initiates engine ignition sequence
B3 The system monitors trajectory and guidance
B4 The system deploys satellite at orbital altitude
B5 The system confirms successful deployment
B6 End UC

Postcondition:
Satellite is successfully deployed in orbit.

Alternative Flows:
A1 at B2a Critical system failure detected
A1.1 The system aborts launch sequence
A1.2 The system activates safety protocols
A1.3 The system notifies mission control
A1.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Launch is aborted, satellite remains on ground.

A2 at B3 Trajectory deviation detected
A2.1 The system attempts guidance correction
A2.2 If correction fails, system initiates abort sequence
A2.3 The system activates recovery procedures
A2.4 End UC

Postcondition:
Mission is aborted, safety procedures activated.
