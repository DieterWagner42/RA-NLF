Found 4 preconditions:
  - Coffee beans are available in the system (UC1)
  - Water is available in the system (UC1)
  - Milk is available in the system (UC1)
  - Sugar is available in the system (UC1)

Generated 12 RA classes from preconditions:

Resource Controllers (4):
  - CoffeeBeansSupplyController: Manages Coffee beans supply and availability (from precondition)
  - WaterSupplyController: Manages Water supply and availability (from precondition)
  - MilkSupplyController: Manages Milk supply and availability (from precondition)
  - SugarSupplyController: Manages Sugar supply and availability (from precondition)

Resource Entities (4):
  - CoffeeBeans: Resource: Coffee beans (required as precondition)
  - Water: Resource: Water (required as precondition)
  - Milk: Resource: Milk (required as precondition)
  - Sugar: Resource: Sugar (required as precondition)

Supply Boundaries (4):
  - CoffeeBeansSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Coffee beans supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - WaterSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Water supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - MilkSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Milk supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - SugarSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Sugar supply monitoring and refill alerts

UC-Methode Rule Compliance:
  [OK] Each precondition generates Controller + Entity + Boundary
  [OK] Domain Orchestrator implicitly coordinates all controllers
  [WARNING] Preconditions should be handled by separate UCs
  [WARNING] Missing UCs for: Coffee beans, Water, Milk, Sugar

Next Step: Create separate UCs for resource supply management

PRECONDITION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Found 4 preconditions:
  - Rocket is fueled and ready (UC3_Rocket_Launch)
  - Satellite payload is installed (UC3_Rocket_Launch)
  - Weather conditions are acceptable (UC3_Rocket_Launch)
  - Launch window is available (UC3_Rocket_Launch)

Generated 12 RA classes from preconditions:

Resource Controllers (4):
  - RocketIsFueledAndSupplyController: Manages Rocket is fueled and supply and availability (from precondition)
  - SatelliteSupplyController: Manages Satellite supply and availability (from precondition)
  - WeatherSupplyController: Manages Weather supply and availability (from precondition)
  - LaunchWindowSupplyController: Manages Launch window supply and availability (from precondition)

Resource Entities (4):
  - RocketIsFueledAnd: Resource: Rocket is fueled and (required as precondition)
  - Satellite: Resource: Satellite (required as precondition)
  - Weather: Resource: Weather (required as precondition)
  - LaunchWindow: Resource: Launch window (required as precondition)

Supply Boundaries (4):
  - RocketIsFueledAndSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Rocket is fueled and supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - SatelliteSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Satellite supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - WeatherSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Weather supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - LaunchWindowSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Launch window supply monitoring and refill alerts

UC-Methode Rule Compliance:
  [OK] Each precondition generates Controller + Entity + Boundary
  [OK] Domain Orchestrator implicitly coordinates all controllers
  [WARNING] Preconditions should be handled by separate UCs
  [WARNING] Missing UCs for: Rocket is fueled and, Satellite, Weather, Launch window

Next Step: Create separate UCs for resource supply management

PRECONDITION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Found 2 preconditions:
  - Coffee beans are available in the system (UC2)
  - Water is available in the system (UC2)

Generated 6 RA classes from preconditions:

Resource Controllers (2):
  - CoffeeBeansSupplyController: Manages Coffee beans supply and availability (from precondition)
  - WaterSupplyController: Manages Water supply and availability (from precondition)

Resource Entities (2):
  - CoffeeBeans: Resource: Coffee beans (required as precondition)
  - Water: Resource: Water (required as precondition)

Supply Boundaries (2):
  - CoffeeBeansSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Coffee beans supply monitoring and refill alerts
  - WaterSupplyBoundary: Boundary for Water supply monitoring and refill alerts

UC-Methode Rule Compliance:
  [OK] Each precondition generates Controller + Entity + Boundary
  [OK] Domain Orchestrator implicitly coordinates all controllers
  [WARNING] Preconditions should be handled by separate UCs
  [WARNING] Missing UCs for: Coffee beans, Water
